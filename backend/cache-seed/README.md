# Bundled cache seed

Everything the app needs to show catalogues and title details **without calling any
provider** (TMDB, Watchmode, OMDb, IMDb, iTunes, NexStream). It ships inside the Docker
image so a fresh Render instance is fast from the first request.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `*_catalogue.json` | Franchise / classics / latest catalogues (Marvel, DC, Bollywood, Hollywood, classics, TV). Rows already embed tmdbId, poster and overview. |
| `poster_map.json` | Title → poster URL lookups. |
| `regional_tv_prebuilt_cache.json` | Prebuilt regional TV pages. |
| `tmdb_ott_availability_cache.json` | OTT availability per title/region (`v2:<id>:<REGION>`). |
| `runtime/` | Files the app also *writes* at run time: TMDB catalogue pages, search metadata, regional movie pages, IMDb ratings, NexStream caches, TV caches. |

Run `python scripts/cache_report.py` for a per-file coverage table (rows, tmdbId, poster, overview).

## How it is used

1. On startup each seed file is copied into `APP_DATA_DIR` (default `/app/data`) **only if the
   destination does not already exist**; the OTT cache is merged. Anything the app learned at
   run time is therefore never overwritten by a redeploy.
2. With `CACHE_FIRST=true` (default) any stored entry — seed or runtime, any age — is served
   as-is. Providers are only asked for entries that do not exist. A user-triggered refresh
   (`force=true`, "clear TMDB cache") still bypasses this.
3. `CACHE_ONLY_MODE=true` (current Render setting) goes further: no provider calls at all.
4. `BACKFILL_MISSING_METADATA=false` additionally stops background gap-filling (synopsis / OTT).

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CACHE_FIRST` | `true` | Serve stored data regardless of age. |
| `CACHE_ONLY_MODE` | `false` (`true` on Render) | Never call providers. |
| `BACKFILL_MISSING_METADATA` | `true` | Background enrichment of missing synopsis/OTT. |
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | `/app/data` | Runtime cache directory (point at a Render disk to keep it across deploys). |
| `CACHE_SEED_DIR` | `/app/cache-seed` | Where the seed is read from. |

## Known gaps

Three titles (43 rows) have no synopsis: *Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Supreme*,
*Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons*, *The Raid: Redemption*. The Marvel movie catalogue only has
page 1 of an older variant. Both need a one-off refresh with real API keys
(`CACHE_ONLY_MODE=false`, `BACKFILL_MISSING_METADATA=true`), then commit the refreshed files.

## Tests

`backend/tests/test_cache_first.py` hits ~100 cached endpoints with all outbound HTTP blocked
and fails if any provider request is attempted.

## Hollywood and Bollywood paging

Each of the six regional catalogues (popular / trending / latest × Hollywood / Bollywood) has
**3 cached pages of 18 titles** (`REGIONAL_MOVIE_PREWARM_PAGES`). Pages 1–3 are served from the cache
and the UI is told a page 4 exists. From page 4 on the backend uses the API keys, continues
right after the cached titles (no repeats) and stores each fetched page so it is only fetched once.
The refresh (`scripts/build_regional_movie_cache.py`) builds each catalogue's finished list: it walks
candidates and keeps only titles with a torrent or a NexStream stream until 54 are found, then stores
them under `catalogues.<name>.final`; the app serves that list as-is. Trending is this week's list,
then earlier weeks from the weekly archive (each title shows the week it trended), then popular
titles to fill what is still missing. This week is added to the archive, so after some weeks the
fill is no longer needed.
This needs `CACHE_ONLY_MODE=false` and TMDB keys on Render (set in `render.yaml`).

## Keeping the data fresh (VPS → rolling GitHub release → Render)

GitHub never stores refreshed data in `main`'s history. Instead:

1. A cron job on the VPS runs `scripts/vps/refresh_and_publish.sh <group>`. It refreshes data with
   live API keys (`scripts/refresh_seed.py`), packs one `cache-bundle.tar.gz` + `cache-bundle.json`
   (checksum, version) with `scripts/make_cache_bundle.py`, uploads them to the rolling release
   `cache-data` (old assets are replaced, so size stays flat) and calls the Render deploy hook.
2. When the Render container starts, `maintenance/fetch_cache_bundle.py` downloads the bundle,
   verifies the checksum, refuses anything unsafe or not valid JSON, and overlays it on the seed
   baked into the image. If anything fails it prints why and the baked seed is used.
3. The app then seeds `APP_DATA_DIR` from it as before and serves everything from local files.

| Group | Suggested schedule | Refreshes |
|---|---|---|
| `hollywood-bollywood` | weekly cron | Regional movie/TV pages, trending archive, shared metadata/OTT/IMDb entries (set `REGIONAL_CACHE_TORRENT_SCAN=false` to skip the slow torrent re-scan) |
| `franchise` | run by hand when wanted | Missing OTT data and synopses for Marvel, DC and classics |
| `imdb-dataset` | by hand (also part of both groups above) | IMDb ratings for every movie, web series and anime from IMDb's free dataset (personal, non-commercial use only), then Cinemeta for what the dataset lacks; no OMDb key needed |
| `tv-imdb` | by hand | Only the OMDb lookups for web series/anime |
| `publish-only` | by hand | Re-publish the VPS working copy |

The VPS keeps its own working copy of the seed (`~/torrent-studio-refresh/seed`), so each group's
results survive the other group's runs. Set `CACHE_BUNDLE_BASE_URL=off` on Render to disable the
download.

### VPS setup (Oracle, Ubuntu)

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git python3-venv curl gh
mkdir -p ~/.config/torrent-studio && chmod 700 ~/.config/torrent-studio
cat > ~/.config/torrent-studio/env <<'EOF'
TMDB_READ_ACCESS_TOKENS=token1,token2,token3   # one kind is enough; TMDB_API_KEYS works too
WATCHMODE_API_KEY=...
OMDB_API_KEY=...
GH_TOKEN=...            # fine-grained token, this repo only, Contents: read and write
RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK=...  # Render service -> Settings -> Deploy Hook
REGIONAL_CACHE_TORRENT_SCAN=true
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.config/torrent-studio/env
git clone https://github.com/wroxtaaar/Torrent-Studio.git ~/ts && cd ~/ts
crontab -l 2>/dev/null; (crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo '0 3 * * 1 /home/ubuntu/ts/scripts/vps/refresh_and_publish.sh hollywood-bollywood >> /home/ubuntu/refresh.log 2>&1') | crontab -
```

Run `scripts/vps/refresh_and_publish.sh publish-only` once to publish the first bundle, and
`scripts/vps/refresh_and_publish.sh franchise` whenever Marvel/DC/classics need an update.
The VPS makes only outbound connections, so no domain, certificate or open port is needed.
